This was my first project done with Thinkful's software engineering course! In the future, I would like to go back to edit a lot of the javascript code, since I beleive I could do a better job of making it shorter and more compact. 
The goal was to create a library page that would sort different catogories of books that were placed in arrays and sorted. The end result is below!
